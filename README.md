Self-Evaluation:

1. Functionality - 3
For functionality, I was able to create an enigma class that is able to encrypt a message and decrypt the encryption. In addition, there are runner files that respond to CLI for for encrypt and decrypt. I was unable to complete the cracking method.

1. Object Oriented Programming - 3.5
For OOP, I was able to identify the responsibility of each class and module I created, breaking them down into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. All classes and modules have their purpose, and communicate with each other properly. I didn't implement inheritance, but I did implement modules successfully.
