<h2>Enigma</h2>

**Self-Evaluation:**

1. Functionality - 3
For functionality, I was able to create an enigma class that is able to encrypt a message and decrypt the encryption. In addition, there are runner files that respond to CLI for for encrypt and decrypt. I was unable to complete the cracking method.

1. Object Oriented Programming - 3.3
For OOP, I was able to identify the responsibility of each class and module I created, breaking them down into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. All classes and modules have their purpose, and communicate with each other properly. I didn't implement inheritance, but I did implement modules successfully.

1. Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 3.2
My code is properly spaced, and besides an outlier of one method at 9 lines, no method exceeds 5 lines. Each data structure and enumerable was picked to the best of my ability, while learning new ones along the way that were implemented into the project. A hash is used in the shifting process, which is an integral part of functionality. However, some methods are not the most efficient.

1. Test Driven Development - 3
I tried to create a test before every method, some may have slipped through the cracks in moments of confusion before returning back to creating a test first, then writing the method. Test coverage is at 100%. Mocks and stubs are used, but may not be used in the best way at times. They are used to prevent randomness and make the testing process more efficient.

1. Version Control - 2.7
More than 50 commits were made, pull requests have comments that detail what went into each one. Some commits include multiple pieces of functionality though, and pull requests could have been more detailed. Each branch could have been grouped into more logical chunks of functionality.
